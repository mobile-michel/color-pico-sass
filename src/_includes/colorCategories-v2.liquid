<h2>Css Color palette with Sass</h2>
<p>Colors on this page are distributed using the 60/30/10 ratio and divided into three categories: primary, secondary, and accent. To provide variety, these categories are further used to generate different tints and shades.</p>
<h3>Primary Colors</h3>
<p>The body background of this page takes the primary color which covers nearly the 60% of the total UI.</p>
<p class="primary">primary with saturation at 40% & lightness at 40%</p>
<p class="primary100">primary100 with saturation at 20% & lightness at 95%</p>
<p class="primary300">primary300 with saturation at 20% & lightness at 70%</p>
<p class="primary500">primary500 with saturation at 20% & lightness at 50%</p>
<p class="primary700">primary700 with saturation at 20% & lightness at 30%</p>
<p class="primary900">primary900 with saturation at 20% & lightness at 10%</p>
<h3>Complement Colors</h3>
<p>A sample paragraph demonstrating the default body text color. Anything that doesn't carry or inherit any text color style will be shown in this color by default.</p>
<p class="complement">secondary with saturation at 40% & lightness at 40%</p>
<p class="complement100">secondary100 with saturation at 20% & lightness at 95%</p>
<p class="complement300">secondary300 with saturation at 20% & lightness at 70%</p>
<p class="complement500">secondary500 with saturation at 20% & lightness at 50%</p>
<p class="complement700">secondary700 with saturation at 20% & lightness at 30%</p>
<p class="complement900">secondary900 with saturation at 20% & lightness at 10%</p>
<h3>Analogous Colors</h3>
<p>The analogous color constitutes about 10% of small but vital details of a UI based on the 60/30/10 rule. <a href="#">Hyperlinks</a> are the most common example where accent is used.</p>
<p class="rightAnalogous">rightAnalogous with saturation at 40% & lightness at 40%</p>
<p class="rightAnalogous100">rightAnalogous100 with saturation at 40% & lightness at 90%</p>
<p class="leftAnalogous">leftAnalogous with saturation at 40% & lightness at 40%</p>
<p class="leftAnalogous100">leftAnalogous100 with saturation at 40% & lightness at 90%</p>
<h3>Grey Colors</h3>
